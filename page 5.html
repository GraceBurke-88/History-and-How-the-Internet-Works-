                <h4>Human Communication</h4>
            Communication is what moves humans, and as so a revolt of the “little guy” to the big media companies was born on the internet.
            Digg and Youtube are quickly becoming the popular new media site. Before, the media was in the hands of big companies that had a monopoly of what went on air, and who could be a part of it. Youtube gives users the power to broadcast themselves, uncensored, and free of the rules that traditional media companies are run by.
            On the same side of that coin, Digg is a news site that provides the power to people on its site to determine what is important, and the “top story”.

                <h4>Music</h4>
            This movement, however new it seems, actually began years ago with music. People who were interested in music began to compress songs into MP3 files, and share them on obscure sites on the internet. David Weekly, a Stanford student, created a site that quickly became number one on the Stanford browser, that allowed users to download the music posted on
            When big music companies found out about the free download and sharing, they began to ban it. Shawn Fanning rebelled against this, and created a program called Napster, which allowed users to download music MP3 files for free. This created a movement that is still going on today.

            <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-white text-dark">
                <h4>Napster</h4>
            Hilary Rosen, head of the Recording Industry Association of America, soon came knocking at Napsters door, informing them this site was illegal, and infringed greatly on copyright. Other people soon realized intellectual property was at risk, and saw Napster as the end of the Music and Movie industry.
            This led to big stars like Dr. Dre and Metallica to publicly denounce Napster. At one point, Metallica’s drummer came into Napsters offices to demand its users be banned from the site. Hillary Rosen, then, sued Napster and got Napster to be shut down.

                <h4>Apple</h4>
            Steve Jobs and Apple soon created iTunes which sold songs for a dollar each, which made music companies satisfied. Napsters shutdown, however, simply led other sites to pick up where Napster shut down, and illegal file downloading and sharing is still popular tod
            Youtube, today, faces a similar issue that Napster did. Media companies denounce, and have sued Youtube for having copyrighted content in their site. Maybe Youtube would have had to face the same fate as Napster, had it not had Google backing it.
            Then, sites like Myspace and Facebook sprang up, becoming prime targets for advertisers to make money.
            Mark Zuckerberg, a then Harvard student, created Facebook as a Harvard site, which soon spread to other colleges, and then highschools, and eventually to the world. Facebook aims to create a service that captures the totality of human relationships, friends, friends of friends, friends of friends of friends, eventually creating a social graph.

                <h4>Ongoing battle for profit</h4>
            Nowadays, it is not a battle of old vs new media, but of new vs new media, and it is an ongoing battle for the most profit and the most traffic.
            Blogging, is furthermore, another rattling new form of media and communication. Today anyone can have a voice online, which leaves newspapers with a big problem
            Sites like craigslist, created by Craig Newmark, are sites that don't seek to make profit, but to provide a service. Wikipedia, open source code, craigslist, are all free and for everyone, harkening the internet back
